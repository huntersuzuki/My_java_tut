Template or boiler plate of Java Program.
========================================

Class ClassName{

    public static void main(String args[]){

           write java code in main method;
    }
}

e.g

Class ClassName{

    public static void main(String args[])
    {
          System.out.print("Hello world");
    }
}


Phases in running a java Code.

Java code written in a file which is saved with .java extension is called as 
Source code file.

javac hello.java 

javac is a compiler which is used to convert source code into byte code which is 
machine readable and not human readable.
In above example javac convert hello.java into byte code file which is named as 
hello.class

hello.java ---------> javac -------> classname.class (bytecode)

classname.class (bytecode) ------> JVM

JVM reside on the top of OS and Hardware.


    

hello.java -------> javac ------> bytecode

JVM stands for Java Virtual machine which helps to execute Bytecode.It create 
java Runtime environment to execute bytecode and get the output.

JVM  perfom following task.
1) Loads the code
2) check the code 
3) excuted code 
4) provide runtime environment 

JRE

JRE = JVM + libraries and files 

         JRE 
 --------------------------
|                           |
|  JVM + libraries and files|
|                           |
|                           |
 --------------------------

JRE  stands for Java Runtime Environment , is software tool kit which consist of 
JVM and some set of libraries and files required for Runtime 
environment.

JDK 
jdk stands for java development kit, it is set of development tools
required to develope application in java.
JDK consist of JRE , Javac a compiler , java an intrepreter etc.

Javac is used to convert source code to byte code.
java interpreter is used to run or execute byte code file.


           Jdk 
 --------------------------
|                           |
|  JRE + Javac + java       |
|                           |
|                           |
 --------------------------


1) Java is platform independent.
   This is because of JVM.
   If a bytecode is created on windows OS and that bytecode is given to 
   mac os where JVM is present, so that bytecode from windows is executed in 
   mac by using java interpreter.

   Thus due to JVM java is platform independent.

   but JVM,JRE,JDK these are platform dependent.



   Three stages of code execution in any language.

   1) input ------> process --------> output 

   In process stage data for processing is stored in a variable.

   Datatype 
   ========
   variable are used to store data in program.For storage there is need of
   temporary memory.
   So how much memory is to be allocated for a variable and what type of
   value is being stored in the variable is defined by datatype.

   What is datatype?
   Datatype in programming lang. specify the type of data being stored in the 
   variable and amount of space required for that storage.

   Types of datatype?
   =================
   Datatype is divided into two type in java.
   1) primitive datatype : basic datatype
   2) non-primitive datatype -> class,interface, arrays etc.

   data can be classified into two Types
   1) Numeric data 
       a) integer  => keyword: int 
       b) floating => keyword: float 
   2) Strings: collection characters
       datatype => string 
   3) Boolean- true and false 

integer  : it contains positive and negative whole numbers. 
floating : it contain decimal numbers.

integer 
              Memory              range 
1) byte       1 byte              -128 to 127 [-2^7 to 2^7-1] 
2) short      2 byte 
3) int        4 byte 
4) long       8 byte 


floating 
             Memory 
1) float     4 byte 
2) double    8 byte 
Default datatype in floating is double.
