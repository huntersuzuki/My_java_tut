Comments in Programming lang.
===========================
comments in any language are unexecutable part of
code. 
Any code written inside comment is ignored by compiler or
interpreter.
Comments are very important as they specify the 
description of the code written.

Types of comments 
=================
1) Single line comment: two forward slashes.
    //  comment start here.

    it will comment single line.
2) multiline comment.

     /*
        line 1
        line 2
        line 3

     */

     This will comment all the lines of code.

     2^-2 =  1     1
            --- = --- = 0.25
            2^2    4

3.4E-38 to 3.4E+38 =>  3.4 10^-38 to 3.4 10^38

Casting and Type Conversion
===========================
Type Casting
1) Converion of one datatype into another datatype is called as Type casting.
2) The conversion in which there is need to mention explicitly the conversion 
   datatype is called as Type casting.

Type conversion
===============
The conversion in which the conversion of one datatype into another datatype 
happend automatically without specifying the datatype explictly is called as
Type conversion.

Interview Question 
==================
1) What is a difference between Type casting and Type conversion.
2) Explain Type casting in Java. [example]
