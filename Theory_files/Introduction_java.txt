Java is a backend scripting Langauge.

Programming language 
===================
The langauge which is used to communicate or to instruct   the machine to get work done is called as
programming language.

1) Low level language
   In this langauage instruction to the machine were written in 1's and 0's which is easy for machine
   to process,but very diffcult for the programmer to program.
2) Assembly level langauge 
   In this era certain keywords or pneumonics were added in langauge to instruct the machine.
   This ease programmer a little bit.

3) Compiled level language - compiler were used 
   code was written in english which was easy for programmer but it  need to be coverted into 
   machin level lang. for the machine to understand. [C and C++]

4) High level language
  Code written in english, but instead of compiler an interpreter is used which converts  high level 
  langauge into machine level language.


Analogy in learning English Language.

Alphabets  ---------->  words---------> sentences (.) --------> paragraph.


Programming language 

Alphabets                   variables 
digits            ------->  constants  --------> Instructions(;)----------> Program.
special symobols            keywords


Alphabets :  A,B,C....Z and a,b,c...z 
digits    :  0,1,2,3,...9
special sy:  #,$,@,!,; etc 


variables 
1) Variable are identifiers that are used to store values in program.[values can be input given by user or it can result of any operations]
2) Variable are temporary memory locations on RAM that are used to store values.
3) Value in the variable remains till programme  is in running mode, once program finished, then variable 
   memory  is released  for future use and value is lost.

Constant 
1) Alphabets/identifiers that are used to store values which never change throughout the program are called as 
   constant.

keywords
========= 
words with reserved or predefined meaning in a language are called as Keywords.
Some keywords are general which are same in all programming language, but some keywords are defined for
that particular language.
e.g if,else,for,while etc.



Instruction 
===========
The command or order given to machine using combination of variable,constant and keywords is called
as Instruction.
Instruction in java ends with semicolon (;)

Program 
======
A collection of instruction that are executed in a defined sequence is called as Program.


In order to create an application in java, there is need of compiler that is going to 
convert code written in java into machine language.

Requirement
1) code editor - VScode [eclipse,net beans]
2) jdk - Java development kit .

History
======
1) Java first owned by sun microsystem.
2) later oracle bought it.

Download JDK and install from the following link
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

latest version as per the todays date and time is 21 which is long term support version [LTS]

download installer from the given option as per the ooperating system.
After download, double click on the installer and continue or press next button to complete the 
installation process.

Confirming installation of Java 
===============================
Open terminal or cmd prompt 

type : javac --version this will give  compiler version as 21 

java --version this will give JRE version 

if version are displyed that is confiramtion of java is being successfully installed on your system.

Set an enviroment system variable path 
==========================
If by executing above command on the cmd or terminal if we are getting 
javac is not recognised as internal or extenal command, this means java is not added in the 
enviroment system variables.

and there is need to set path in the system environment path.

copy : C://program files/java/jdk21/bin 
and add this path in system variable path.

start cmd prompt again to reflect the changes and then java will be recognised as internal or 
external command.


jshell
====== 
jshell initiate java environment in the terminal or in cmd prompt where we can write 
instruction in java and execute immediately line by line.

to start jshell in terminal or cmd prompt use following command.

jshell
