Types of Operators 
===================
1) arithmetic Operators
2) Assignment Operators 
3) relational Operators
4) logical operators.

Arithmetic operator 
+,-,/,*,% 

Assignment operator 
= is called as assignment operator which is used to assign 
value from right hand to left hand variable.

x=6 i.e 6 value on right side 6 is being assigned to 
left hand side variable [left assignment]

x=1

x=x+2 => x=1+2=3

x=x+2 => x+=2 [short hand operator]
x=x-2 => x-=2
x=x*2 => x*=2
x=x/2 => x/=2
x=x%2 => x%=2


relational operator 
==================
<,>,<=,>=,==,!=

Result of relational operator is either true or false.

logical Operators 
=================
logical and => &&
logical or  => ||
logical not => ! 

logical and , or are binary operands.
Since they work on two condition made up from relational
operators.

not is called as unary operator as it works on one 
condition.
